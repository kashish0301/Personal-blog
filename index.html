     <h2>The Link Between PCOS and Mental Health</h2>
     <p>
       Let’s be honest. Living with PCOS isn’t “fun”. Between the hirsutism, acne, infertility and all of the other symptoms, it can leave us feeling down (to put it mildly).
But is there possibly more to it than just feeling down as a result of our symptoms? Well researchers looked at 70 women with PCOS between the ages of 18 and 45 who did not have any prior mental health diagnosis.
After interviewing them and using various scales and measures, they found something interesting.
About 25.7% of the women assessed struggled with depression while 38.6% of them struggled with anxiety.
Breaking that research down a little further, the researchers also found that the PCOS symptoms infertility and alopecia were associated with anxiety while acne was associated with depression and women with hirsutism tended to have a lower quality of life.
This clearly shows a definite link between PCOS and anxiety, as well as other mood disorders.

<b>Hormonal Factors</b>
We know that women with PCOS have tended to have a very specific hormonal profile, with higher levels of insulin and androgens. It is these two hormones that lead to more of the well-known symptoms of PCOS – weight gain, hirsutism (hair growth) acne and infertility.
But research has also shown that insulin resistance and high levels of androgens are also strongly linked with anxiety and depression, irrespective of BMI and age (2).
The BMI point is an important one because even you have lean PCOS with insulin resistance, you will be more prone to anxiety and depression.
<b>The Psychological Impact of PCOS</b>
Yes, PCOS does cause us to have this major hormonal imbalance that makes us more prone to anxiety and depression. But there is something else that we need to consider.
It is this: “Living with PCOS sucks”.
If you have PCOS, you know exactly what I’m talking about. Having hair growth where you don’t want it and shouldn’t have it, struggling to get pregnant when it seems like everyone around you is getting pregnant, piling on the pounds when you’ve been eating rabbit food for months – it all pretty much sucks.
And that has a huge impact on our psychological well-being. It makes us more prone to anxiety and depression (3).
We’re also not as likely to be open about our PCOS and symptoms and that makes getting the support that we need even more difficult.
So, there are a number of reasons that we’re more prone to anxiety than the general population.
Let’s have a look at some of the symptoms of anxiety.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Physical Symptoms of Anxiety</strong>
<ul>
<li>a churning feeling in your stomach</li>
<li>feeling light-headed or dizzy</li>
<li>pins and needles</li>
<li>feeling restless or unable to sit still</li>
<li>headaches, backache or other aches and pains</li>
<li>faster breathing</li>
<li>a fast, thumping or irregular heartbeat</li>
<li>sweating or hot flushes</li>
<li>problems sleeping</li>
<li>grinding your teeth, especially at night</li>
<li>nausea (feeling sick)</li>
<li>needing the toilet more or less often</li>
<li>changes in your sex drive</li>
<li>having panic attacks</li>
</ul>
     </p>
<br>
     <h3>What you can do about Anxiety with PCOS?</h3><br>
     <p>
<strong>Follow a PCOS Diet</strong>
I know that this is something that I go on about a lot but there is a reason for this – it works.
One of the ways that we can change our hormone profile and manage our insulin and testosterone levels is to change that way that we eat. Not only will our hormones be more healthy and reduce the risk of anxiety and depression, we will also start to improve the actual symptoms of PCOS that may be causing the psychological distress.
So, a PCOS Diet is important.
If you’re wondering what on earth you should be eating to improve your PCOS, head on over to “The Best PCOS Diet” for more info.
<br>
<strong>Take Your Supplements</strong>
When talking about supplements for PCOS, there are always 3 that come to mind – Inositol, Vitamin D and Omega 3.
They have wonderful effects for PCOS and there is a lot of good research to support their use in PCOS.
Helpfully, the research has shown that supplementing with Vitamin D and Omega 3 can improve the symptoms of depression and anxiety in women with PCOS as well.
<br>
<strong>Yoga</strong>
And yoga has also been shown to improve anxiety in women with PCOS. Some researchers looked at 90 adolescent girls with PCOS and divided them into two groups – 1 groups was an exercise group while the other group was the yoga group.
After participating in either yoga or exercise over a period of 12 weeks, the yoga group showed significantly improved levels of anxiety, compared to the yoga group.<br>
So, if you are struggling with anxiety and you have PCOS, I want to encourage you. It isn’t “just you”. There are some very real and very valid reasons that you are struggling and there is a cause for your anxiety.
The other great news is that there are some things that you can do about it. So don’t lose heart!
